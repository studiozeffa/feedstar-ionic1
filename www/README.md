This is an addon starter template for the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/).

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. It is missing the Ionic library, and AngularJS. Use the `ionic start` command to begin an Ionic project with this template:

```
ionic start feedstar https://github.com/fiznool/feedstar-starter
```
